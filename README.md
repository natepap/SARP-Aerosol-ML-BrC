# SARP-Aerosol-ML-BrC
 ML project to predict brown carbon levels in atmospheric samples

Using FIREX-AQ MERGE data from NASA, this network aims to use standard aerosol and WAS measurements and predict light absoption due to BrC, a much more complicated thing to measure directly.

Currently supervised, intended to become a semi-supervised network.
