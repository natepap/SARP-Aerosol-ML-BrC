LOCATION: Aircraft location is given by the navigational file
ASSOCIATED_DATA: N/A
INSTRUMENT_INFO: WPI LWCC, Ocean Optics USB4000 spectrometer and GE Sievers 900 TOC Portable Analyzer
DATA_INFO: Filters were first extracted in 15 ml of water, dried and then extracted again using 15 ml of methanol. Each extract was filtered with a 0.22 um pore size syringe filter and then injected through a 2.5 m path length LWCC and light absorption measured by Ocean Optics USB4000 spectrometer. Absorption from 300 to 700 nm were recorded. Absorption of pure solvent was subtracted from the sample. Raw absorption data were processed by the equation Abs=Raw*(Volume of extraction liquid)/(Volume of air collected at STP)/(Optical Path Length, 2.5m here)*ln(10). Data reported here were averaged over 20 nm wavelength intervals. i.e. absorption at 400 nm were average by absorption data between 390 nm to 410 nm. Ambient WSOC concentration derived from liquid WSOC concentration with similar equation. All data have been blank corrected by averaging all blank filter in this mission (2-3 blank filters per flight). Limit of detection (LOD) was determined by three times standard deviation of blank data. Data are reported under STP, which is T=273K & p=1013 mb. When using the data, the absorption had better to corrected by higher wavelength, ie Abs700 for baseline drift.
